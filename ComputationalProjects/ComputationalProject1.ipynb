These future needs include housing, schools, care for the elderly, jobs, and utilities such as electricity,water and transportation.\n","\n","2. businesses do population planning so as to predict how the portions of the population that use their product will be changing.\n","\n","3. Ecologists use population models to study ecological systems, especially those where endangered species are involved so as to try to find measures that will restore the population.\n","\n","4. medical researchers treat microorganisms and viruses as populations and seek to understand the dynamics of their populations; especially why some thrive in certain environments but don't in others.   \n","\n","Using data about the current population along with the knowledge of quality of healthcare, life expectancy, birth rates, and so on, one can create a model that predicts how the population will change over time.\n","\n","For example, in Japan and Scandinavian countries, data shows that a large portion of the population is in an older age group and birth rates are low, which suggests that the size of their populations might shrink over time.  On the other hand, countries with a large birth rate might still suffer from shrinking populations if the quality of health care is very low (such that it significantly effects \"survival rates\" and decreases life expectancies).\n","\n","<b>We are going to work with a particular population model to predict how population distribution across age groups changes over time.</b>\n","\n","## Your Project\n","\n","Suppose we are studying the population dynamics of Los Angeles for the purpose of making a planning proposal to the city which will form the basis for predicting school, transportation, housing, water, and electrical needs for the years from 2000 on.\n","\n","\n","### The Model\n","\n","1. First, we will consider seven age groups: 0-9 year olds, 10-19, 20-29, up to 60+.  It make sense to take intervals of 10 years as the census is taken every 10 years.\n","\n","<table>\n","   <tr>\n","     <th>Age Group</th>\n","     <th>Ages (years) </th>\n","  </tr>\n","  <tr>\n","    <td><b>Group 1</b></td>\n","    <td>0-9<td>\n","  </tr>\n","  <tr>\n","    <td><b>Group 2</b></td>\n","    <td>10-19<td>\n","  </tr>\n","  <tr>\n","    <td><b>Group 3</b></td>\n","    <td>20-29<td>\n","  </tr>\n","  <tr>\n","    <td><b>Group 4</b></td>\n","    <td>30-39<td>\n","  </tr>\n","  <tr>\n","    <td><b>Group 5</b></td>\n","    <td>40-49<td>\n","  </tr>\n","  <tr>\n","    <td><b>Group 6</b></td>\n","    <td>50-59<td>\n","  </tr>\n","  <tr>\n","    <td><b>Group 7</b></td>\n","    <td>60+<td>\n","  </tr>\n","</table>\n","\n","2.

We will also incorporate our knowledge about birth rates, quality of health care, life expectancy, etc. to model how the current population distribution (i.e., how many people are in each age group today) influence the population distribution ten years from now into numbers which we will call \"survival fractions\".  <br> <br> The **survival fraction** of an age group is the fraction of people in an age group who will survive to the next age group ten years later.<br> <br> \n","For example, the fraction of \"newborns\" (0-9) who survive to ages 10-19, the fraction of 10 to 19 year olds who survive to 20-29, etc. This type of data is compiled, for example, by actuaries working for insurance companies for life and medical insurance purposes.\n","\n","<b>Example</b>\n","+ Suppose that there are initially 1000 newborns, 600 people aged 10-19, and 1000 people aged 20-29: $$\\vec x(0) = \\begin{bmatrix}x_1(0)\\\\ x_2(0) \\\\ x_{ 3}(0)\\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1000 \\\\ 600 \\\\ 1000\\end{bmatrix} $$\n","\n","+ Suppose that the survival fraction of newborns who survive to age 10 is 0.99 and the survival fraction of 10-19 year olds who survive to 20 is 0.95\n","\n","+ Then, 10 years later, at time $t= 1$, the number of people aged 10-19 would be:\n","    $$x_2(1) = 0.99 \\times x_1(0) = 990$$\n","   etc.\n","\n","<b>More generally</b>\n","\n","The basic equations we begin with are\n","\\begin{equation}\n","\\vec x(t+1) = A\\vec x(t), \\quad t=0,1,2, \\ldots  \\tag{1}\n","\\end{equation}\n","where \n","  + $x(0)$ is a given vector of initial (at time $t = 0$) number of people within each age group, and $x(t)$ denotes the number of people within each age group at time $t$.\n","  + Each vector $x(t)$ has 7 entries:\n","  $$ x(t) = \\begin{bmatrix} x_1(t) \\\\ x_2(t) \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ x_7(t) \\end{bmatrix}$$\n","  where $x_1(t)$ is the number of people in the first age group at time $t$, etc.\n","  + $A$ is a matrix that helps us model how populations in the different age groups change.
